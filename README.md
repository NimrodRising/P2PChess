# P2P Chess
## What is this?
The goal of this project is to build a website on which user can play chess with their friends without the need to sign up for an account. In the end, using this website, users will be able to create a game by simply sending a link to their friends. Once set up, games are completely peer to peer. 
## Why am I making this?
I love chess and would like something like this to exist. I also thought it would be an interesting exercise to learn about chess programming as I would like to eventually build a chess engine.
